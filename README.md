# Bubble Sort Algorithm 🧼🔁

This repository contains a simple and clean implementation of the **Bubble Sort algorithm** in Python.  
It also includes an optimized version that stops early if the list is already sorted.

## 📌 What is Bubble Sort?

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
It’s called “bubble” sort because the largest elements "bubble up" to the top of the list with each pass.
